/*   ------ PROMISES

A Promise in JavaScript is a way to handle asynchronous tasks (like fetching data from an API) that may not finish immediately.

Key Points:
Pending: The task is not yet done.
Resolved/fulfilled: The task completed successfully.
Rejected: The task failed.

A Promise is a way to handle tasks that take time, and it lets you deal with success or failure later.
